problem_statement: |
  In laying water mains, utilities must be concerned with the possibility of freezing during cold periods.
  Although the problem of determining the temperature in soil as a function of time is complicated by changing surface conditions, reasonable estimates can be based on the assumption of a constant surface temperature over a prolonged period of cold weather.
  What minimum burial depth x_m would you recommend to avoid freezing under conditions for which soil, initially at a uniform temperature of {T_i}, is subjected to a constant surface temperature of {T_s} for {t}?

assumptions: |
  1. One-dimensional conduction in x.
  2. Soil is a semi-infinite medium.
  3. Constant properties.
comments: |
  The properties of soil are highly variable, depending on the nature of the soil and its moisture content, and a representative range of thermal diffusivities is 1e-7 < α < 3e-7 m^2/s.
