problem_statement: |
  Consider a steel pipeline (AISI 1010) that is {D} in diameter and has a wall thickness of {L}.
  The pipe is heavily insulated on the outside, and before the initiation of flow, the walls of the pipe are at a uniform temperature of {T_i}.
  With the initiation of flow, hot oil at {T_inf} is pumped through the pipe, creating a convective condition corresponding to {h} at the inner surface of the pipe.
  1. What are the appropriate Biot and Fourier numbers {t} after the initiation of flow?
  2. At t = {t}, what is the temperature of the exterior pipe surface covered by the insulation?
  3. What is the heat flux q_dot'' (W/m^2) to the pipe from the oil at t = {t}?
  4. How much energy per meter of pipe length has been transferred from the oil to the pipe at t = {t}?

assumptions: |
  1. Pipe wall can be approximated as plane wall, since thickness is much less than diameter.
  2. Constant properties.
  3. Outer surface of pipe is adiabatic.
comments: |
  Lumped capacitance model is invalid for Bi > 0.1.
  However, one-term approximation is valid for Fo > 0.2
